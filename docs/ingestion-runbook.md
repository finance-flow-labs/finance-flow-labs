# Ingestion Runbook

## Core Flow

1. Evaluate source with legal/reliability hard gates.
2. Ingest raw payloads into append-only raw store.
3. Run quality gate checks.
4. Promote passing batches to canonical facts.
5. Route failing batches to quarantine.
6. Serve research queries with point-in-time filters.

## Safety Rules

- Never overwrite historical raw records.
- Enforce `available_at <= decision_time` for replay and backtesting.
- Freeze new source onboarding if monthly budget is exceeded.

## Tier Policy

- Gold: no TTL expiration.
- Silver: 180-day raw cache, 24-month facts.
- Bronze: 30-90 day cache window.
